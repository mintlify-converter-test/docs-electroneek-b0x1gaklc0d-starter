# Introduction

When you create a bot in Studio Pro, you start by creating a project. In a logical sense, the project contains all the files that can be compiled into an executable bot. Those files can include workflow, images, data files, and so on. By default, your project also has a configuration file that contains platform settings (browser settings, etc.) and user-defined settings (variables, etc.).

## Create project

In order to create a New Project, you need to click on the **"Create project"** button as shown below:

<img className="block" src="images/files_readme_io/_797dc0f_image.png" alt="" />

After you have clicked on the button, a window will appear with the following parameters:

1.  **Name:** the name of your project, you can choose any name.
2.  **Location:** the location of the new project on your computer.
3.  **Main file name:** the name of your main file in the `.neek` format.

<img className="block" src="images/files_readme_io/_ebe6e66_image.png" alt="" />

## Open project

In order to open the existing project, you need to click on the **"Open project"** button as shown below:

<img className="block" src="images/files_readme_io/_528abf4_image.png" alt="" />

After you have clicked on the button, you should specify your project folder on your computer and click the "Select folder" button as follows:

<img className="block" src="images/files_readme_io/_422ad2d_image.png" alt="" /><Info>

## Note

Double-clicking on the main `.neek` file will not open the project, but the workflow contained in this file.

</Info>

## Playground

There is a special mode in Studio Pro, which you can see on the start screen:

<img className="block" src="images/files_readme_io/_debded8_image.png" alt="" />

This mode can help you when you would like to quickly check the functionality of all activities or even implement a bot. Also, you can save your bot to a single `.neek` file. However, you cannot use the configuration file, convert to your bot to the`.neex` format, and upload it to Orchestrator SaaS.

# Project structure tree

In Studio Pro, your project is organized in a hierarchy of subfolders — a project tree. The highest folder of your project is the project folder itself. By default, the tree structure is subdivided into eight parts:

1.  **elements** — this subfolder contains activities that interact with desktop elements.
2.  **execute\_js\_code\_scripts** — this subfolder contains the JS scripts used by your bot.
3.  **screenshots** — this subfolder contains activities that interact with images.
4.  **logs** — this subfolder contains logs. You can learn more about logs in this article.
5.  **termelements** — this subfolder contains activities that interact with terminal elements.
6.  **webelements** — this subfolder contains activities that interact with web-elements.
7.  **main.neek** — this executable file is the entry point of the bot, you can choose it yourself.
8.  **project.json** — this is a project configuration file.

<img className="block" src="images/files_readme_io/_601298a_image.png" alt="" />

You can add folders or`.neek` files, and rename `.neek` files using the context menu if you right-click in the **Project** tab.

<img className="block" src="images/files_readme_io/_5845942_2023_12_22_10_38_52_transformed.png" alt="" />

Also, you can drag-and-drop files and folders.

The colored titles and specific messages help improve your workflow. Here's what they mean:

*   **Red icon** \- Error message (Workflow logic errors + Infrastructure errors)
*   **Yellow icon** \- Warning messages
*   **Green icon** \- Information messages

<Info>

## Note

**Workflow** logic errors refer to unexpected behavior within the workflow structure/elements.

**Infrastructure** errors pertain to phenomena independent of workflow execution, such as corrupted files, third-party service issues, extension problems, etc.

</Info>

The "Refresh" option next to the colored icons allows you to reset the counter. Clicking it turns all messages in the expanded console gray. The same occurs when running a new workflow. This makes it easy to identify messages from the last executed workflow, as they are highlighted with colors.

By clicking on the "Settings" icon, a menu appears with the following options:

*   **Open Log Folder** \- Takes you to the log folder.
*   **Maximize All** \- Expands all messages in the console.
