# Overview

ElectroNeek Bot Library is a User Portal section where you find **pre-built bots** to deliver business value faster and more efficiently to your customers. Using its intuitive environment, you can access realistic **RPA use cases** along with **instructions and videos** to build these workflows from scratch in your own projects.

Additionally, start applying these insights to your workflows immediately by **downloading the template** you want — then you can use it in your Studio Pro. By doing that, you take a step further and optimize the use of RPA resources, so you can offer an even more effective service to your customers — and make room for retaining them.

Bot Library help you to achieve **faster implementation** of bots, which positively impacts productivity and scalability.

Let us take a look at the resources you find in this section.

1.  Hit the drop-down list to filter bots by categories such as "Technology, "Industry", "Department", and so on.
    
2.  Use the search bar to find bots by title, description, or tag.
    
3.  Click "Try it" to open a specific bot.
    

Each page is structured this way:
