## Capabilities

Studio Pro's AI capabilities allow for the creation of workflows using a range of learned activities, including "assign-variable," "console-log," "condition," "read-file," "delay," and "cmd." These activities offer a robust set of tools to build precise and efficient automation workflows, and we are continuously working to expand the selection with more activities in the future.

## ️Important

By using AI tools, you interact directly with Artificial Intelligence, which means we can’t predict what answers you can retrieve or the accuracy of the information generated.
