# Overview

Working with ElectroNeek products involves creating and managing a team of users. Within the team and the product, there are user [roles](/docs/user-access-management#team-roles)
. Depending on the role assigned, a user may have different abilities to interact with the product and manage the team.

<Info>

## Note

Having the role of **Owner** or **Admin**, you are automatically added to all new products of our Ecosystem.

# Adding users to a team

To invite a user to a team, go to _User Portal → Account → Team_.

Click **"Invite Users"** to select a role for the user.

## Note

Organizations can only have one "Owner". This role cannot be deleted but can be transferred through the team management tool within the User Portal. When the role is reassigned, the former Owner will be demoted to the Admin role. Enter the e-mail address of the person you want to invite, and send the invitation.

## Note

You can specify one or more addresses manually (press "Enter" or "Space" to go to the next address) or copy the list of addresses. Note that the copied addresses in this case must be separated by commas without spaces.

## Granting permissions for specific products

Then you can assign the desired users to [Studio Pro](/docs/studio-pro)
 or [Orchestrator SaaS](/docs/orchestrator)
 programs. Go to **Edit User**, navigate through the tabs and check the corresponding permissions.

Now that you have added more users and given them permission to use the required products, they will be able to start working with them.

The **[Business Hub](/docs/marketing)
**, **[Automation Hub](/docs/easley-ai)
** and **[Service Hub](/docs/support-center)
** collapsible menu sections of the cards on the home screen allow you to access all products and download them or use them directly from the [**User Portal**](https://na.electroneek.com/account)
.

# Roles and permissions

## Introduction

ElectroNeek roles and permissions system makes it possible to differentiate the existing platform components from each other for specific users. That being said, it is possible to manage access to the desired products based on what kind of work your Team members do.

Roles are divided into Team roles and product-specific roles. Team roles apply to a Team in general while product-specific roles define the level of permissions within a single product.

Here is the [guide](/docs/im-an-admin#adding-new-team-members)
 that explains how setting up Team members and their roles works.

## Team roles

When a user joins the Team, he or she can have one of the following roles: **Owner**, **Admin**, **Member**, and **Billing Contact**. Here are the details about these roles.

1.  The **Owner** is in charge of a Team. Features:
    *   Can invite anybody to the Team.
    *   Can modify roles for anybody.
    *   Can grant permissions for other users to use any product.
    *   Can revoke the permissions to use the product.
    *   Can exclude a member from the Team.
    *   Can not be deleted by anyone on the Team.

<Info>

## Note

Organizations can only have one "Owner". This role cannot be deleted but can be transferred through the team management tool within the User Portal. When the role is reassigned, the former Owner will be demoted to the Admin role. Enter the e-mail address of the person you want to invite, and send the invitation.

</Info>

2.  The next role is **Admin**. This role is typically used to permit persons to manage specific products. It is mostly similar to the Owner, but an Admin is unable to remove the Owner from the Team.

<Info>

## Note

Having the role of Owner or Admin, you are automatically added to all new products of our Ecosystem.

</Info>

3.  **Member** is the most common role. They do not have any specific rights regarding the Team. Members can be assigned to any product.
4.  **Billing contact** users have access to the Billing Page.

## Product-specific roles

We have just reviewed the roles related to a Team in general. Now let us review the roles according to the specific products.

### Studio Pro

There are no specific roles for [Studio Pro](/docs/studio-pro)
. This means that any persons who are eligible to use this program can do any kind of work in Studio including building and running bots.

### Bot Runner

There are no specific roles for [Bot Runner](/docs/bot-runner-1)
. Anyone can use it freely when running attended bots. For unattended bots, users need to have the corresponding rights and permissions.

### SaaS Orchestrator

There are two roles in [Orchestrator](/docs/orchestrator)
: **Admin** and **Analyst**. You can learn more about roles in Orchestrator in this article.

*   **Admin** — all Orchestrator SaaS functionality is available. Admins can publish and schedule bots, use API and webhooks, and use integrations and the multitenancy feature.
*   **Analyst** — not all Orchestrator SaaS functionality is available. Analysts can monitor bot performance, view dashboards, and logs. However, they cannot modify settings and manage bots.

# Existing in multiple organizations

## Description

With the release of [ElectroNeek Summer '21](https://electroneek.com/newsroom/product-news/introducing-electroneek-summer-21-release-and-the-new-intelligent-capabilities-for-managed-service-providers/)
, users now have the ability to be a member of multiple Teams (organizations) at the same time. When you receive an invitation letter from an organization, all you have to do is follow the activation link. If your organization has already created an account, you do not need to register: you are logged in with the role and privileges set by the inviting organization administrator. If the account hasn't been created, you will need to register for the organization as before.

## Authorization in products

If you are a member of more than one organization at the same time, when you sign in to [Studio Pro](/docs/studio-pro)
, [Bot Runner](/docs/bot-runner-1)
, and the [user portal](https://electroneek.com/account/auth/login/start)
, you can choose which organization to sign in to.
