# Security Groups

A new feature named “**Security Groups**” was introduced along with Process Hubs. A **Security Groups** is just a group of users that will share a common security characteristic.

**Security Groups** are managed in the **Team** section of the ElectroNeek platform. Only the platform Owner or users with an Admin role can create Security Groups and add members to it.

A user can belong to multiple groups.

In Process Hub the Security Groups are used to provide Launch permissions to the users belonging to them.
