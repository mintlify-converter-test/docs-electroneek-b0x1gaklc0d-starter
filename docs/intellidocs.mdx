# Overview

ElectroNeek IntelliDocs is a managed service provider (MPS) product that allows you to implement **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)** in your document operations without the need for programming your own platform. Using it, you can quickly apply IDP to extract information from various document types with high accuracy and without the requirement of AI training.

On ElectroNeek's User Portal, you can generate API Keys to implement IntelliDocs in your workflows. You can extract information from images of documents such as driving licenses, invoices, and more, with a **99%+ accuracy rate**. Additionally, you have the ability to manage API Keys for each Document Stream, providing individual authorization for using IntelliDocs in their projects.

IntelliDocs top capabilities include:

*   **Document recognition and extraction**
*   **Wide range of document types**
*   **Advanced document processing features** (e.g. handwriting, barcodes, etc.)
*   **User-friendly interface**

Also, you can manage API Keys for each Document Stream you have, so you provide them with individual authorization to use IntelliDocs on their projects.
