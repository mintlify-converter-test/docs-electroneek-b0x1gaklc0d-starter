## ️Important

By using AI tools, you interact directly with Artificial Intelligence, which means we can’t predict what answers you can retrieve or the accuracy of the information generated.

## Input

This parameter allows you to **input the text data** that you want to edit. You can do this in one of the following three ways:

*   **Set a value** — to add the text data manually
*   **Calculate a value** — to use syntax (code) structure to generate the text data
*   **Save the previous step result** — to apply the output of the previous activity

Make sure to enter the text data accurately to prevent errors.

## Instruction

Use this property to specify **the action you want the AI to perform** on the text. You can work with the same three options:

*   **Set a value** — to add instruction manually
*   **Calculate a value** — to use syntax (code) structure to generate the instruction
*   **Save the previous step result** — to apply the output of the previous activity as instruction
