# Read text file

## Description

This activity is used to read the content of a text file.

Similar to other activities related to reading files, an 'Assign value to variable' action block connected to this block will also appear upon adding this block to the workflow. This variable will store the contents of the read file.

However, using the 'Assign value to variable' activity is not strictly necessary in this case. It is safe to delete this block and handle the result any other way. For example, if you want to send the content of the text file in an email 'as is', i.e. without changing the content in any way then you could use the 'Send email' activity right after 'Read text file' and specify the **Save the previous step result** option in the **Body** parameter.

## Parameters

This activity has three parameters: File type, Path (required), and Encoding.

Speaking of File type, there are two options. You can either choose any common text tile format such as .txt, .log, .ini, and others or JSON format.

<img className="block" src="images/files_readme_io/_ea10d44_image.png" alt="File type parameter" />

File type parameter

If the `JSON` option is selected, the output of this will be a variable of object type (JavaScript). This means that you can easily address the keys and values, for example, `file_content[“name”]`.

The **Path** parameter lets you define the location of the file you are going to read. As usual, it can be set manually, dynamically, or by saving the previous step result. Also, you can specify the needed file using Explorer by clicking the **Pick** button.

<img className="block" src="images/files_readme_io/_17f12c4_image.png" alt="Path parameter" />

Path parameter

### Encoding

This parameter allows you to specify the encoding. Here's a full list of the supported ones:  
`437`, `737`, `775`, `850`, `852`, `855`, `856`, `857`, `858`, `860`, `861`, `862`, `863`, `864`, `865`, `866`, `869`, `874`, `922`, `1046`, `1124`, `1125`, `1129`, `1133`, `1161`, `1162`, `1163`, `1250`, `1251`, `1252`, `1253`, `1254`, `1255`, `1256`, `1257`, `1258`, `28591`, `28592`, `28593`, `28594`, `28595`, `28596`, `28597`, `28598`, `28599`, `28600`, `28601`, `28603`, `28604`, `28605`, `28606`, `maccroatian`, `maccyrillic`, `macgreek`, `maciceland`, `macroman`, `macromania`, `macthai`, `macturkish`, `macukraine`, `koi8r`, `koi8u`, `koi8t`, `armscii8`, `rk1048`, `tcvn`, `georgianacademy`, `georgianps`, `pt154`, `viscii`, `iso646cn`, `iso646jp`, `hproman8`, `macintosh`, `ascii`, `tis620`, `utf7`, `utf8`, `cesu8`, `ucs2`, `utf16`, `utf16le`, `utf16be`, `binary`, `base64`, `hex`, `932`, `shiftjis`, `csshiftjis`, `mskanji`, `sjis`, `windows31j`, `ms31j`, `xsjis`, `windows932`, `ms932`, `cp932`, `936`, `cp936`, `gb2312`, `gb231280`, `gb23121980`, `csgb2312`, `csiso58gb231280`, `euccn`, `windows936`, `ms936`, `949`, `cseuckr`, `csksc56011987`, `euckr`, `isoir149`, `korean`, `ksc56011987`, `950`, `eucjp`, `gbk`, `gb18030`, `big5`.

### Results

Let us have a look at how the read text is represented. In this case, we used the 'Assign value to variable' action.

This is the source file we used for an example.

<img className="block" src="images/files_readme_io/_1977f95_image.png" alt="" />

And this is how its contents are displayed in the variable.

## A few notes about JSON format

This is how a simple `JSON` file can look like in a variable.

<img className="block" src="images/files_readme_io/_aff8038_image.png" alt="" /> <img className="block" src="images/files_readme_io/_ef561fe_image.png" alt="" />

## Usage examples

You can use this activity in different situations.

For example, if a project has a settings document for business users, then you may use this activity right at the beginning of your workflow to check the existence of that file. If it does not exist, you can register that in a log file with a corresponding message.

In another scenario, you may want to register the result of your workflow. Using this activity, you can check if there is already a file created for that purpose. In this case, you open the file and add the new information. Otherwise, your workflow can trigger another activity that creates a new file.

All you need to do is tell your bot how to proceed in case of YES and NO situations.

2.  **Save the previous step result**: chooses the previous activity result as a path.
3.  **Calculate a value**: enables you to use available properties and methods to form a path.

### Return full paths to files and folders

This parameter will return the full paths to files and folder (without the checkbox checked there will be only names of files returned).

### Return files from subfolders

With this checkbox checked there will be all the files from the subfolders returned into the variable.

### Comment

Contains an annotation to the activity. The input text will be displayed above the activity name.

## Result

The list of files and folders is stored in the `directory_files` variable by default. This variable represents an array of strings. For example, if in the specified folder there are folders "documents", "reports" and files "scan.png", "employees.xlsx", "agreement.docx" then the output array of string will be the following: `["agreement.docx", "documents", "employees.xlsx", "reports", "scan.png"]`.

## Interaction with folders

This activity can interact not only with files, but also with folders. In order to specify the folder path, you need to copy it from the file explorer and paste it manually to the parameter **Path**. Keep in mind that the **Pick** button will not allow you to pick folders.

# File trigger

## Description

This activity monitors the selected folder and executes other actions when a specific file appears in this folder or disappears from it. If the set event happened, then Yes branch will be executed. Otherwise, No branch will be executed.

A good usage of this activity is to perform some actions with the file immediately after it appears in the folder. Here is how it can look like.

In this example we wait for the file to appear, write some text to it and then move it to another folder

## Parameters

There are two main required parameters: **Folder to monitor the event** and **Event**.

**Folder to monitor the event** defines the folder where the file is expected to appear or disappear.

Folder to monitor the event parameter

**Event** defines what exactly should happen: other action can be triggered either if the file has appeared or disappeared.

Selecting the type of event

It also includes two other options. You can set the activity to trigger if any kind of file appears in the folder, or define a specific file.

Also note that **Wait for any file to appear** and **Wait for a specific file to appear** options return a complete path to the file.

If you select the **Wait for a specific file to appear** option, you will be able to set a specific file name or extension. Check one of these options or both according to the task.

It is also possible to set its extension

If **Disappearance** event was selected, the options will look similarly. It is possible to either trigger the other actions when the folder becomes completely empty or when only a specific file disappears. It is also possible to set the name and/or extension of this file.

If the **Wait for the folder to become empty** option is selected, then the activity will not return anything. If the **Wait for a specific file to disappear** option is enabled, then the activity will return the name of this file.
