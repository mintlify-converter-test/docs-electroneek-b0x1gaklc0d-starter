Once you develop a bot, you can run it directly from Studio Pro. Still, you can do way more than that with **remote deployment** using ElectroNeek [Bot Runner](/docs/bot-runner-1)
. Install this easy-to-use product in the computers you want to run your bots in and log in to your ElectroNeek account. After that, you have different methods to remotely deploy a bot:

*   Export a NEEX file from Studio Pro and execute it using Bot Runner;
*   Connect Bot Runner to [Orchestrator SaaS](/docs/orchestrator)
     and schedule the bot execution from User Portal.

To your business, that means you don't need to install Studio Pro on every device to run workflows from them. Bot Runner is a lighter, faster option to achieve that goal in just a few clicks, so you can expand your automation network and manage all the Bot Runners from a single point.
