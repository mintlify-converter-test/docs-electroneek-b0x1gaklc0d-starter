## How Process Hub works

1.  The Process Manager creates a Process workflow for a specific Business Process using the available Stages.
2.  The Process Manager provides execution rights to the desired Security Groups. All the users within the specified Security Group will see the Process in the Processes section.
3.  When the Process is executed:
    *   A new Job is created
    *   A task for each Stage is created and assigned to a human or AI Automation Agent (RPA Bot).
    *   Notifications are sent to Task owners (assignees).
4.  Tasks are completed by Humans or AI Automation Agent (RPA Bot).
5.  When the Tasks are completed the data generated by them are passed to the process workflow.
6.  The Job will continue executing stages until the last stage is completed or ended prematurely by the Logic stage.
