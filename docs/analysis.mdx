ElectroNeek products collect and organize data from each bot execution, so you can perform data analysis to monitor workflows, manage your bots, and improve your automation processes. In Studio Pro, you can use the **Output Data tab** to save specific information about each running. With this data on hand, you are able to use it in other applications.

On Orchestrator SaaS, you find the **Collect execution logs automatically** button. Toggle this option to save detailed information about each bot execution. Moreover, you can use the **Console log** activity to collect console messages. In both cases, the data is stored in Orchestrator SaaS for future analysis.
