The **Drag & Drop** method is a basic feature of Studio Pro that you can use to build bots with no coding skills at all. The process is quite simple: you **click and hold** the activity you want to drag it from the left sidebar and then you drop it into Studio Pro workspace: the **canvas**.

With this intuitive approach, you can easily select the tools you need to interact with and add them to your workflow. Here's an example:

<img className="block" src="images/files_readme_io/_b6f4c19_Draggif.gif" alt="" />

The Drag & Drop feature is as simple as dragging an icon from one place to another. It's intuitive, easy to use, and allows you to build bots quickly and efficiently. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced user, this feature will save you time and help you create complex workflows with ease.
