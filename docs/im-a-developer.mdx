After successful installation, you will see the image below. Click the **'Finish'** button to finalize the process. A new desktop shortcut will be automatically created.

It is also possible to launch the program by ticking the **'Run ElectroNeek Studio Pro'** box. In this case, we assume that this box was unchecked and we did not launch the program right away.

# Step 2. Launching and login

Now we are ready to launch the Studio program and log in to the newly created account.

## Launching

Locate the desktop shortcut icon created during the installation process. Double-click it to start the Studio Pro loader. This loader will assess whether all the prerequisites for running Studio Pro are in place.

After successful login, you should see this window. It shows the validity period of your license. If you can see this window, then the account activation process was successfully finished. You can now close this window and start working with the platform.

## Note

The users added to a Team inherit the products license expiration date. This means that the users or other employees you have previously added using your Admin Account on the website have the same license expiration date you can see in this window.

# What to do if your customer requires to include ElectroNeek to a 3rd-party marketplace

## What is this?

ElectroNeek is a platform helping IT Service Providers across the globe to empower their businesses. When an IT Service Provider wants to implement ElectroNeek solutions to a customer and the customer requires the inclusion of ElectroNeek to a list of trusted vendors or to a specific marketplace, you should follow the process described in this article to get it done.

## What's ElectroNeek's position?

ElectroNeek welcomes such requests and aims to help the IT Service Provider. Before making the final decision whether ElectroNeek approves being included in the marketplace or the list of trusted vendors of a specific customer, ElectroNeek needs to have an understanding of what is required to successfully complete the process. This is when the IT Service Provider steps in. It is crucial that the IT Service Provider collects all the necessary information and provides it to ElectroNeek in order to speed up the process.

## What is the process?

First, ElectroNeek has to understand the use case and the customer's request for being included in their list or marketplace. It’s important that the IT Service Provider collects all possible knowledge about the use case, the details, and nuances, and shares this information with ElectroNeek.

Secondly, it is important to provide a list of all the necessary documents and/or agreements. It is likely that inclusion in a marketplace or a list of trusted vendors requires certain agreements to be concluded and ElectroNeek needs to know about them.

At this point, it’s possible that ElectroNeek has to share some sensitive data or sensitive information with the customer. In that case, the IT Service Provider needs to let ElectroNeek know about it.

Finally, the IT Service Provider needs to provide the steps ElectroNeek needs to take to complete the process of inclusion or at least to get started.

## Who is the contact person in ElectroNeek?

Every IT Service Provider has its own Success Manager so this is the person you should contact to start the process of including ElectroNeek in the customer's marketplace or list of trusted vendors.
