# Overview

## Prerequisites

Once you have created a bot using Studio Pro, you can **export it to a NEEX file** in order to execute it using Bot Runner. This first step is simple: click on _Menu → File → Export to .neex_.

The second prerequisite is to have Bot Runner installed in your computer.

# Deploying via Bot Runner

After the NEEX file is saved, you can run it by **double-clicking the left mouse button**. If Bot Runner is installed and running on the computer, the workflow starts automatically.

You can also run the workflow directly through Bot Runner. To do this:

1.  Open Bot Runner
2.  Go to the **Welcome** tab
3.  Click on **RUN BOT**
4.  Select the NEEX file

Done! You have just deployed your bot via Bot Runner.

## Note

You can also use Orchestrator SaaS to request Bot Runner to execute the bot remotely. Learn more about this process in this article.
